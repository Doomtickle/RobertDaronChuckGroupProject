##HIGH PRIORITY TO ENSURE PROPER CALCS
1. <strong>*Make sure all nextButton.setOnAction calls set member variables and make sure all text fields make use of NumbertTextField.java along with an updated regex to ensure proper number formating*</strong> most methods should do this except maybe the getcarFees() and getregHotelFees() as I changed these to fit the getMeals() Plese double check each method except the getMeals() as this works how it should and was a major pain to make so please don't change this.
