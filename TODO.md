<strong>OTHER TODO</strong>                

1) We need a global change to all the get methods instead of using  ".setPromptText()" methods
 all text fields taking a monetary value should be using ".setText(00.00)" that way in the input
is skipped by the user 00.00 is used automatically this will give a similar effet as the prompt
text ,but also do the job of initialzing our variable with a 00 amount with out the user having to do
extra steps.
